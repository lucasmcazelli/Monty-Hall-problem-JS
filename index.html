    <h1>Monty Hall Simulator</h1>
    <p>The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle. You pick one of several doors, behind one of which is a car and behind the others are goats. After your pick, Monty, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door to reveal a goat. You then get the chance to stick with your original choice or switch to another door. The question is: Is it in your best interest to switch or not?</p>

    <p>This simulation demonstrates the Monty Hall problem by running multiple rounds and updating the results in real-time. One simulation will stick with the original door choice, and the other will switch.</p>
